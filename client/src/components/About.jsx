                <p>We are a group of coders who loves to play games with our friends.
                    <br/>
                Our goal for this project was to build an application that brings gamers together.
                    <br/>
                Gamer's Paradise is a social site where users can share video games they have played recently and other users can review and comment their opinions about those games.
                    <br/>
                We hope you enjoy!
