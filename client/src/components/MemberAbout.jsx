                We are a group of coders who love to game out with our friends.
                    <br/> 
                Our goal for this project was to build an application that brings gamers together. 
                    <br/> 
                Gamer's Paradise is a social site where users can share video games they have played recently and other users can review and comment their opinions about those games. 
                    <br/>    
                We hope you enjoy!
