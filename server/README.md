    - Adding and Linking foreignkey columns from User Table to Posts Table
    - Pulling User's specific username for every Post

  - Calling displayname instead of username to show up on the pages.

- Wednesday 1/13/21:
  - Trying to attach the game model and the post model
  - Would not send the game information with each post because the relationship was not there
